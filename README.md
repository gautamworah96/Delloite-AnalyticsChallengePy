# Delloite-AnalyticsChallengePy
Contains all the scripts used to analyze the csv file and derive insights.

The analytics challenge required the participants to use the dataset given at https://opendata.socrata.com/Government/Airplane-Crashes-and-Fatalities-Since-1908/q2te-8cvq and derive meaningful insights from it.
The dataset contains all records for airplane crashes from 1908-2009.

I have used Python,Excel,Google Sheets,Matplotlib to generate the data,graphs.

Feel free to use it and drop a message in case of any doubt..

Cheers
